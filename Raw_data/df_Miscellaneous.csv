q5_jFRZErEI,"DtS is not a documentry, even not in the loosest sense. DtS is a docu-soap, this format gives a lot of liberties. DtS is also not ment for petrolheads, they follow F1 anyway. DtS is for the soap consuming, non petrol heads who just like a storyline. DtS is just another soap, the only diference is the subject racing and theire drivers. DtS does it&#39;s job by atracting non-racing ethousiast to racing.",0,2023-01-25T14:37:25Z
q5_jFRZErEI,The show got me hooked on the sport but I&#39;m not surprised Netflix would pull this kind of crap,0,2023-01-24T15:45:02Z
q5_jFRZErEI,Netflix needs to learn real storytelling by watching the Porsche documentary series with Michael Fassbender going into Le Mans. It&#39;s the best show I have ever seen motorsport related.<br><br><br>Best part is that it&#39;s free to watch on Youtube,0,2023-01-23T18:07:13Z
q5_jFRZErEI,"Netflix only brings in newbie viewers to F1, no real fan wants to watch last year gossip stories. No real fan cares about &quot;drive to survive&quot;.",0,2023-01-23T14:46:04Z
q5_jFRZErEI,"In respect to what was said at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5_jFRZErEI&amp;t=4m37s"">4:37</a>, where exactly do F1 cars go 230+ mph.?",0,2023-01-22T03:39:17Z
q5_jFRZErEI,Multiple &#39;amateurs&#39; on youtube made a much better season oversight of F1 than drive to survive is doing,1,2023-01-20T10:26:03Z
q5_jFRZErEI,It is called &quot;dumbing down&quot;<br>I think the Netflix audience are &quot;soap opera&quot; fans.<br>There has been a change in fan base in F1 over the recent years.<br>From a knowledgeable petrol head towards a &quot;football&quot; and &quot;soap&quot; mentality.<br>I for one do not like it.<br>I bet the promotors love it ..<br>ca-chiinng ££££$$€€¥₩₽<br>Problem is our Political system use the same techniques under different names and not with Netfix .. yet.,2,2023-01-20T09:12:03Z
q5_jFRZErEI,Well the show also helped F1 youtube channels like this to grow because more people will be searching for F1 content on youtube. So yea there&#39;s good and bad things,6,2023-01-19T04:47:31Z
q5_jFRZErEI,Fans of the show loved DTS but fans of the sport find it overly dramatized.,1,2023-01-19T03:59:24Z
q5_jFRZErEI,"It’a a lot of talk and meaningless complaints.. in the end all of them (FIA, F1 and Netflix) made money of it and managed to increase the audience and the F1 base, especially in the USA so I see this to bi continued in the future, probably just a little bit toned down.",2,2023-01-18T22:37:07Z

q5_jFRZErEI,"I haven&#39;t seen the series- tried, and honestly didn&#39;t like it. Mostly due these facts from the video. As someone who&#39;s already involved into F1 world, it was a... bad joke more or less.<br>Nice video!",2,2023-01-18T22:15:42Z
q5_jFRZErEI,Haven&#39;t even watched 1 second of Drive to Survive! Everything I&#39;ve read and heard is that Netflix&#39;s &quot;artistic freedom&quot; is more about a purposefully inaccurate and manipulated season documentary in the name of drumming up drama that isn&#39;t there (or drumming it up higher than it really is). Amazon did a good job with their &quot;All or Nothing&quot; series and the &quot;Grand Prix Driver&quot;.,3,2023-01-18T22:07:09Z
q5_jFRZErEI,"I have hopes now Max is on board, but im not too hopeful. I rather wait and see. If its good, i&#39;ll watch. If not I won&#39;t waiste my time on the show ever again",2,2023-01-18T21:43:44Z
q5_jFRZErEI,Drive to Survive is a missed opportunity to make a good documentary. It really is steaming pile of horseshit,9,2023-01-18T20:25:34Z
